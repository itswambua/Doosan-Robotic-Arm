## We assume you have the initial setup ubuntu 22., ros-humble, and docker. 
# Doosan ROS2 is implemented at the distribution ROS2-humble.
# Step by step instructions are at https://github.com/doosan-robotics/doosan-robot2

# Before commit to github, remove build/ install/ and log/ directories by creating .gitignore files.
# This prevents the large ros project files from being tracked by git
